Unity Labs is the future research group at Unity Technologies. We are a group of research scientists, game industry veterans, machine learning experts and technical artists working on research in many domain like animation, navigation and pathfinding, machine learning and rendering. This respository holds a growing collection of research papers, supplemental material and source code for the research we have made public.
